## Setup
- **Data**: 500 scanned docs with labeled signatures.
- **Model**: YOLOv8n + custom head.
- **Metrics**: mAP@0.5, recall, precision.

## Results
- mAP@0.5 = 0.71 (baseline 0.54)
- Recall = 0.76 (baseline 0.61)

## Artifacts
- Model weights: `weights/exp0001.pt`
- Sample outputs: `assets/exp0001/*.png`

## Discussion
- Failure cases: low-contrast scans; cursive overlaps.
- Next: augment with ink bleed + rotation.
